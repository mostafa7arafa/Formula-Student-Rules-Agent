- **Question 1**: "What is the difference between the autocross and the trackdrive events?"
  - **Answer**:
    ```
    The Autocross and Trackdrive events in Formula Student are distinct in their objectives and procedures:
    
    Autocross
    Objective: Evaluates vehicle maneuverability and handling qualities on a tight course.
    Course Specifications:
    Average speeds are targeted between 40 km/h and 48 km/h.
    The course includes straights (no longer than 60 m) and hairpin turns, with constant turns having a diameter between 23 m and 45 m.
    Procedure:
    Each team may attempt up to four runs, with two drivers allowed, limited to two runs per driver.
    Timing starts when the vehicle crosses the starting line and ends when it crosses the finish line.
    Penalties are applied for hitting cones during the run.
    Trackdrive
    Objective: Typically focuses on the vehicle's performance in a more open and less constrained environment compared to Autocross.
    Course Specifications: Generally allows for higher speeds and may include varied terrain.
    Procedure: Involves a more extended course designed to assess the vehicle's performance over a longer distance, often prioritizing endurance and speed over tight maneuverability.
    In summary, while both events assess the vehicle's performance, Autocross emphasizes tight handling and maneuverability, whereas Trackdrive focuses on overall performance over a longer and potentially faster course.
