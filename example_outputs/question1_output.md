    Overview of Driverless Rules in Formula Student
    The following are key regulations related to driverless vehicles in the Formula Student competition:
    
    Driving Under Power:
    
    Vehicles must only move under their own power within designated Dynamic Areas unless directed otherwise by officials.
    Driving outside of scheduled events or practice leads to penalties: a 200-point penalty for the first violation and disqualification for a second violation.
    Driving Offsite:
    
    Any vehicle found to be driven at an offsite location during the competition will result in exclusion from the competition.
    Driver Equipment:
    
    All driver equipment and harness must be worn whenever the driver is in the cockpit with:
    The internal combustion (IC) engine running or electric vehicle (EV) tractive system active.
    From the start of a Dynamic run until its completion or abandonment.
    Removal of any driver equipment during a Dynamic event will lead to disqualification.
    Drivers Meetings:
    
    Attendance at drivers meetings is mandatory. A driver who fails to attend will be disqualified from the event.
    Dynamic Area Limitations:
    
    Specific restrictions may be imposed by the organizers regarding the number of team members and items allowed in the Dynamic Area and Staging Area.
    Stalled & Disabled Vehicles:
    
    If a vehicle stalls and cannot restart without external assistance or is damaged, it will be scored as Did Not Finish (DNF) for that run. Disabled vehicles will be cleared from the track by track workers.
    Flags:
    
    Command flags must be obeyed immediately. Specific flags include:
    Black Flag: Pull into the Driver Change Area for discussion with officials (possible time penalty).
    Black Flag with Orange Dot: Mechanical inspection required.
    Blue Flag: Indication to pull into a designated passing zone for faster competitors.
    This summary encapsulates the critical rules surrounding driverless vehicles in the Formula Student competition, ensuring compliance and safety during events.
